# Enhancing Road Safety Through Predictive Modelling of Motor Vehicle Collisions


<!-- MOTIVATION -->
## Motivation

The motivation behind this project stems from the ongoing challenge of road safety, a critical concern in urban areas worldwide. Motor vehicle collisions not only lead to significant loss of life and property but also have a profound impact on public health and urban planning. By leveraging data-driven insights, this project aims to:

- **Reduce Accident Rates**: Understanding the factors that contribute to collision severity can inform more effective safety measures.
- **Inform Policy and Urban Planning**: Data-informed insights can guide policymakers and urban planners in developing safer roads and traffic systems.
- **Advance Public Safety Initiatives**: By predicting collision severity and identifying risk factors, we can contribute to public safety strategies that potentially save lives.
- **Promote Data-Driven Decision Making**: Demonstrating the power of machine learning in real-world applications, encouraging data-driven approaches in public governance.

Our commitment is to use data science not just as a tool for analysis but as a means to make a real-world impact, particularly in enhancing road safety and reducing traffic-related fatalities.

## Datasets

The dataset, encompassing 1.84 million records and 29 columns, details collisions in New York City as reported by the police department. It includes comprehensive information such as <b>crash date, time, location, borough, collision ID, and the number of persons, pedestrians, and cyclists injured or killed. Additionally, it covers contributing factors behind the collisions, types of vehicles involved </b>, and other relevant features.

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing and EDA**: Initial data cleaning and exploratory analysis to understand the dataset.
2. **Clustering with K-Means**: Segmented accidents into three categories - severe, moderate, and low.
3. **SMOTE for Class Imbalance**: Addressed the class imbalance problem using the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE).
4. **Algorithm Comparison**:
   - **SVM, KNN, Random Forest, XGBoost**: Implemented for identifying accident contributing factors.
   - **Naive Bayes**: Used for predicting the severity of the accidents with an 80% accuracy rate.
